PyTest Molecule Plugin :: auto detects and runs molecule tests

----

This plugin enables pytest discovery of all ``molecule.yml`` files inside the
codebase and runs them as pytest tests.

Once you install pytest-molecule you should be able to just run ``pytest`` in
order to run molecule on all roles and scenarios.

Optionally you can define ``MOLECULE_OPTS`` for passing extra parameters to
each molecule call.

Discovered tests do have molecule ``driver`` and ``platforms`` added as
markers_, so you can selectively limit which test types to run:

.. code-block:: shell

    # Lists all tests that uses docker
    $ pytest --collect-only -m docker

    # Runs scenarios with platform named centos7 and delegated driver:
    $ pytest -m delegated -m centos7

If the molecule scenario does not contain information about the driver, the
test associated with it gets a ``no_driver`` mark.

Please note that at this moment molecule will run the entire scenario if the
markers are platforms, this is not *yet* a way to limit which platforms are
executed inside a specific scenario.

All tests are added the ``molecule`` marker.

This plugin also adds a new pytest option named
``--molecule-unavailable-driver=skip`` which can be used to tell it what to do
when molecule drivers are not loading. Current default is ``None`` but you
can choose marks like ``skip`` or ``xfail``.

The plugin adds ``--skip-no-git-change`` option which an be used to skip tests
on unchanged roles according to ``git diff`` result and thus can only be used
only when running pytest inside a git repository. It takes one argument and old
refspec used as a reference. For instance calling:
``pytest --skip-no-git-change HEAD^`` will result in molecule of roles that
weren't changed in the last commit being skipped.


Using xfail and skip markers
----------------------------

If you need to skip or ignore a particular scenario, just add either ``xfail``
or ``skip`` to markers list inside its config file.

.. code-block:: yaml

    markers:
      - xfail  # broken scenario, pytest will run it but ignore the result

Installation
------------

You can install "pytest-molecule" via pip_ from PyPI_:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ PIP_NO_BUILD_ISOLATION=false pip install pytest-molecule

``PIP_NO_BUILD_ISOLATION`` is needed only on ancient python distributions to
workaround https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/5229

Contributing
------------
Contributions are very welcome. Tests can be run with tox_, please ensure
the coverage at least stays the same before you submit a pull request.
